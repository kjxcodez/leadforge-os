# Phase 19: Production Qualification, Security Hardening & Adversarial System Validation

## 1. System-Wide Invariant Matrix

This matrix maps every major architectural invariant in LeadForge OS across its authoritative source, runtime enforcement layer, observable evidence, test suite, potential failure modes, and recovery mechanisms.

| Major Invariant | Authoritative Source | Enforcement Layer | Observable Evidence | Test Suite | Failure Mode | Recovery Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CAMPAIGN SAFETY** | MongoDB `CampaignModel.status` & `settings.pauseReason` | Scheduler CAS loop & Automation Worker | Campaign status `'PAUSED'`/`'STOPPED'` in API/UI, zero new execution dispatches | `campaign-lifecycle-safety-phase15.test.ts`, `production-qualification-e2e.test.ts` | Stale SQLite projection reports campaign as active | Scheduler reconciles MongoDB authority before claim; `USER_REQUESTED` pause reason is never overwritten |
| **EXECUTION SAFETY** | MongoDB `SequenceExecutionModel.state` & `currentStep` | Scheduler CAS + Send Lease (`sendLeaseExpiresAt`) | Execution state `'WAITING'`, `'COMPLETED'`, or `'STOPPED'` with monotonic step progression | `scheduler-execution-hardening.test.ts`, `crash-matrix-qualification.test.ts` | Worker crashes mid-send | Startup recovery rolls back uncompleted claims; expired lease triggers safe recovery |
| **CONTACT EXCLUSIVITY** | MongoDB unique index `{ workspaceId, contactId, sequenceId, active: true }` | API Enrollment Route & Database Unique Constraints | Duplicate enrollment returns `409 Conflict` / `ALREADY_ENROLLED` | `workspace-concurrency-stress.test.ts`, `production-qualification-e2e.test.ts` | Concurrent enrollment requests for same contact | Database unique index rejects duplicate; transaction rolls back cleanly |
| **SUPPRESSION** | MongoDB `SuppressionModel` & SQLite `suppressions` | Send-time `evaluateOutreachEligibility()` in worker | Contact `emailStatus: 'SUPPRESSED'`, delivery skipped with audit note | `inbound-suppression-phase17.test.ts`, `adversarial-cross-race-qualification.test.ts` | Dispatch attempt against suppressed recipient | Eligibility check evaluates normalized email before provider invocation, blocking outbound send |
| **INBOUND REPLY SAFETY** | MongoDB `EmailDeliveryModel.processingStatus` | Reconciliation Worker + Email Service | Delivery `processingStatus: 'MATCHED'`, contact `status: 'REPLIED'`, execution `state: 'STOPPED'` | `inbound-suppression-phase17.test.ts`, `adversarial-cross-race-qualification.test.ts` | Reply arrives while step is queued | Step dispatch evaluates contact `status === 'REPLIED'` immediately before send, halting sequence |
| **TEMPLATE IMMUTABILITY** | MongoDB `TemplateVersionModel` (immutable versions) | SDK Variable Resolver & Template Service | Delivery records `templateVersion: N` and static `variablesSnapshot` | `outreach-lineage-phase16.test.ts`, `adversarial-cross-race-qualification.test.ts` | Template edited while campaign is active | Active executions retain pinned `templateVersion`; newly created versions do not mutate historical deliveries |
| **DELIVERY LINEAGE** | MongoDB `EmailDeliveryModel` & SQLite `email_deliveries` | Outbound Dispatch Pipeline | Delivery stores `executionId`, `campaignId`, `messageFingerprint`, `stepIndex` | `outreach-lineage-phase16.test.ts`, `production-qualification-e2e.test.ts` | Corrupted delivery record | Delivery record is created before dispatch and finalized with provider message ID; fingerprint matches canonical preview |
| **MAILBOX HEALTH** | MongoDB `EmailAccountModel.health` | Pure predicate `isMailboxEligibleForDispatch()` | Health state `'COOLDOWN'`, `'AUTH_REQUIRED'`, or `'DEGRADED'` in Operations Center | `operational-reliability-phase18.test.ts`, `phase18-concurrency-stress.test.ts` | Rate limit (429) received from provider | Mailbox transitions to `COOLDOWN` with backoff; executions defer due time; manual reset endpoint restores `HEALTHY` |
| **AMBIGUOUS SEND SAFETY** | MongoDB `EmailDeliveryModel.ambiguous` | Email Service Error Classifier | Delivery flagged `ambiguous: true`, zero automatic retries | `operational-reliability-phase18.test.ts`, `adversarial-cross-race-qualification.test.ts` | Socket hang up / network timeout mid-send | Error mapped to `EmailFailureCategory.AMBIGUOUS`; job halts; reconciliation polls Sent folder before retry |
| **RETRY SAFETY** | Single-owner execution queue (`JobModel.attempt` / `maxAttempts`) | Scheduler & Queue Worker | `attempt` increments monotonically; exponential backoff applied | `scheduler-execution-hardening.test.ts`, `phase18-concurrency-stress.test.ts` | Competing retry policies across layers | Execution queue is the sole retry owner; nested HTTP retries disabled; max attempts capped at 3 |
| **DEAD-LETTER SAFETY** | MongoDB `JobModel.isDeadLetter` | Job Queue Dispatcher | Job moved to dead-letter queue with full lineage references (`executionId`, `mailbox`, `lastError`) | `operational-reliability-phase18.test.ts`, `phase18-concurrency-stress.test.ts` | Retry attempts exhausted without success | Job marked `isDeadLetter: true`; surfaced in Operations Center; operator 1-click requeue resets attempt to 0 |
| **PROJECTION CONSISTENCY** | MongoDB authoritative collections | `ProjectionService.rebuildWorkspaceProjection()` | SQLite table counts match MongoDB collections exactly | `operational-reliability-phase18.test.ts`, `adversarial-cross-race-qualification.test.ts` | SQLite corrupted or deleted | `rebuildWorkspaceProjection()` truncates and streams authoritative MongoDB records directly into SQLite |
| **WORKER HEALTH** | In-memory `WorkerWatchdog` + SQLite `worker_watchdog` | Watchdog heartbeat & crash tracker | Real-time status updates broadcast over IPC; status `'CRASHED'` after 5 failures | `operational-reliability-phase18.test.ts`, `phase18-concurrency-stress.test.ts` | Worker enters infinite crash loop | Watchdog bounds crash restarts to max 5 within evaluation window, then halts worker and alerts operator |
| **MULTI-TENANT ISOLATION** | MongoDB `{ workspaceId }` scoping on all queries | API Authentication Middleware & Workspace Context | All endpoints require workspace context; cross-tenant queries return 403/404 | `workspace-concurrency-stress.test.ts`, `phase19-security-authorization.test.ts` | Hostile tenant queries resource of another tenant | Scope guard verifies ownership; unauthorized requests rejected with zero state leakage |
| **OPERATOR AUTHORIZATION** | Authenticated User Session & Role RBAC | Express Auth Middleware & IPC Validators | Sensitive actions audited with `operatorId` and timestamp | `phase19-security-authorization.test.ts` | Unauthenticated / renderer forgery of actions | Every operational mutation validates user session and workspace membership before execution |

## 2. End-to-End Campaign Test Architecture
The end-to-end qualification suite exercises the complete lifecycle of cold email outreach in a realistic multi-step campaign:
1. **Workspace Setup**: Isolated workspace provisioned with an email account in `HEALTHY` state.
2. **Contact Ingestion**: 100 distinct contacts enrolled in the campaign.
3. **Step 1 Dispatch**: Initial cold outreach dispatched to all 100 contacts. Deliveries, fingerprints, and variables recorded.
4. **Intermediate State & Delay**: Campaign enters `WAITING` state for step interval. Due timestamps correctly scheduled.
5. **Adversarial Inbound & Bounce Injection**:
   - 10 contacts reply (`REPLIED` -> sequence halted).
   - 5 contacts bounce (`BOUNCED` -> primary address suppressed; secondary address remains eligible).
   - 5 contacts administratively suppressed (`SUPPRESSED`).
6. **Provider Rate Limit Encounter**:
   - Outbound batch encounters provider HTTP 429 -> Mailbox enters `COOLDOWN` (15 minutes).
   - Campaign automatically defers executions without dropping state.
   - User manually pauses campaign during cooldown -> `pauseReason: 'USER_REQUESTED'` recorded.
   - Cooldown expires -> Campaign remains safely `PAUSED` due to manual pause preservation invariant.
   - User resumes campaign -> Sequence execution resumes cleanly.
7. **Step 2 Dispatch**: Remaining 80 eligible contacts receive step 2. Replied, bounced, and suppressed contacts receive zero sends.
8. **Final Parity Verification**: Delivery counts, execution states, lineage references, and SQLite projections evaluated against MongoDB authority.

## 3. Execution Crash Matrix (Boundaries A–Q)
The crash matrix validates that process termination at any point in the execution pipeline cannot produce duplicate sends, orphaned executions, or corrupted state:

| Boundary | Crash Point | Invariant Asserted | Reconciled Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | Before execution claim | No execution state change | Execution remains in `WAITING`/`PENDING` and is claimed on next scheduler tick |
| **B** | After claim, before CAS commit | No job dispatched | SQLite CAS rolls back; execution released back to `WAITING` |
| **C** | Before job creation in queue | No duplicate job | Startup recovery releases claimed execution back to queue |
| **D** | After job creation, before worker pickup | Job remains in queue | Worker restarts and processes job normally |
| **E** | Before worker starts step execution | No partial state | Worker claims job via lease; lease expiration allows re-claim |
| **F** | Inside SEND_EMAIL before provider request | Zero outbound requests sent | Send lease expires; job retried without duplicate send |
| **G** | During provider request (network timeout) | Ambiguous send protection | Marked `EmailFailureCategory.AMBIGUOUS`; sent folder polled before retry |
| **H** | After provider accepts request, before delivery record | Provider sent message | Provider message ID captured from sent folder reconciliation; no duplicate |
| **I** | Before delivery finalization | Sent message recorded | Delivery record updated with status `SENT` on recovery |
| **J** | After delivery finalization, before step increment | Step advancement guaranteed | Next tick detects delivery exists and advances `currentStep` |
| **K** | During WAITING transition | Delay scheduled | Execution state updated to `WAITING` with accurate `nextDueAt` |
| **L** | During campaign pause | Pause preserved | Execution immediately stops; queued jobs discarded or yielded |
| **M** | During campaign resume | Safe restart | Only eligible pending executions resumed |
| **N** | During account disconnect | Dispatch halted | Outbound send halted with `AUTH_REQUIRED`; campaign paused |
| **O** | During inbound reconciliation | No orphan replies | Delivery remains `CORRELATION_PENDING` and re-evaluated on next poll |
| **P** | During SQLite projection update | Local cache recoverability | Projection service repairs row or re-syncs from MongoDB |
| **Q** | During projection rebuild | Atomic transaction safety | Rebuild executes in atomic transaction; interrupted rebuild re-runs cleanly |

---

## 4. Concurrency & High-Load Architecture
- 100+ concurrent operations across 10 isolated workspaces.
- Contention tested across:
  - Concurrent duplicate enrollments for single contact (unique index enforcement).
  - Multiple campaigns dispatching via a shared mailbox.
  - Simultaneous reply arrival during outbound send execution.
  - Concurrent cooldown resets and worker crash events.

---

## 5. Security Hardening & Authorization Matrix
- Cross-tenant resource authorization verified across all API routes.
- External input fuzzing across IDs, emails, notes, filters, and JSON payloads.
- Secret scanning ensuring tokens and credentials never appear in logs or SQLite.
- IPC channel security ensuring renderer processes operate strictly within authenticated workspace bounds.

## 7. Authoritative Answers to Core Architectural Invariants

### 1. Campaign State Safety (Pause / Resume / Stop across Server, Desktop, and Workers)
- **MongoDB Authority**: MongoDB is the sole authority for campaign state (`status: 'ACTIVE' | 'PAUSED' | 'STOPPED'`).
- **User Manual Pause Invariant**: When an operator pauses a campaign (`pauseReason: 'USER_REQUESTED'`), this reason is persisted in `campaigns.settings`. System events such as mailbox cooldown expiration (`MAILBOX_COOLDOWN`) or scheduled un-throttling are programmatically prohibited from clearing or resuming a campaign marked `USER_REQUESTED`.
- **Worker Concurrency**: Workers verify campaign status at claim time and immediately prior to outbound network dispatch. If an operator pauses a campaign while jobs are in flight, the step handler yields execution safely without creating deliveries.

### 2. Waiting Execution Recovery (Due-Time, Step Delays, and Recovery)
- **Deterministic Scheduling**: Step delays are computed from the prior step's completion timestamp and stored as ISO-8601 UTC strings in `sequence_executions.nextExecutionAt`.
- **Lexicographical Correctness**: SQLite evaluates due executions using `nextExecutionAt <= ?`, which is strictly monotonic and immune to local timezone skew.
- **Interrupted Delay Recovery**: If a worker or scheduler crashes during delay calculation, the transaction rolls back cleanly; upon restart, the scheduler recalculates the delay from the last finalized delivery.

### 3. SQLite Due-Time Correctness (Boundary Conditions & Future Delays)
- **Boundary Precision**: Executions scheduled for `T + 1ms` in the future are strictly invisible to scheduler sweeps running at `T`. Same-day delays and multi-day delays are evaluated against exact ISO boundaries.
- **Zero Drift**: Scheduler sweeps never round or truncate due timestamps, preventing premature dispatch under sub-second clock ticks.

### 4. Scheduler Crash Recovery (In-Flight Claims & Restarts)
- **Two-Phase CAS Claim**: Scheduler claims executions via SQLite atomic Compare-And-Swap (`status = 'RUNNING'` where `status = 'WAITING'`).
- **Crash Prior to Queue Dispatch**: If the process crashes after SQLite CAS but before the background job is dispatched to the worker queue, the startup recovery sweep detects orphaned `RUNNING` executions with expired leases and safely resets them to `WAITING`.
- **Zero Work Loss**: No execution is marked `COMPLETED` until delivery is finalized and recorded in the ledger.

### 5. Startup Recovery (Orphaned Running Executions & Leases)
- **Lease Timeout**: Every claimed execution is assigned a send lease (`sendLeaseExpiresAt = now + 60s`).
- **Startup Sweep**: Upon desktop or worker boot, `recoverOrphanedExecutions()` scans the database for any execution in `RUNNING` whose lease has expired or whose worker PID is no longer alive, resetting them to `WAITING` for immediate processing.

### 6. MongoDB Authority vs. SQLite Read Projection
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: MongoDB is the authoritative write master for all multi-tenant core data. SQLite is an ephemeral, local read-accelerating cache.
- **Zero Direct Worker Writes**: Background workers write audit logs and deliveries to MongoDB; the main process reconciles and projects authoritative changes into SQLite.
- **Idempotent Rebuilds**: If SQLite is corrupted, deleted, or incomplete, `ProjectionService.rebuildWorkspaceProjection()` executes an idempotent `INSERT OR REPLACE` transaction from MongoDB, restoring full parity with zero data loss.

### 7. Contact Exclusivity Across Campaigns
- **Exclusivity Enforcement**: A contact can only be actively enrolled in one cold outbound sequence per workspace at any given time.
- **Unique Constraint**: The database enforces contact exclusivity via unique indexes and enrollment pre-flight checks. Attempting to enroll an already-active contact returns `409 Conflict` (`ALREADY_ENROLLED`).

### 8. Mailbox Disconnect & Reconnect Safety
- **Immediate Dispatch Halt**: When a mailbox experiences OAuth revocation, invalid credentials, or disconnection, its status transitions to `DISCONNECTED` / `AUTH_REQUIRED`.
- **Pre-Send Mailbox Eligibility Gate**: The dispatch worker evaluates `isMailboxEligibleForDispatch()`. If disconnected, all active executions for that mailbox are deferred or paused, preventing provider bounce loops.
- **Safe Reconnection**: Upon re-authentication, health state transitions to `HEALTHY`, allowing campaigns to resume without duplicate enrollment.

### 9. Reply Race Handling (Inbound Arrival vs. Outbound Send)
- **Sub-Millisecond Protection**: When an inbound email is reconciled as a reply from a contact, the contact is marked `status = 'REPLIED'` and all associated sequence executions are transitioned to `status = 'STOPPED'` with `metadata.stopReason = 'REPLIED'`.
- **Pre-Flight Send Verification**: The outbound send worker queries the sequence execution status immediately before dispatching the HTTP send call. If `status !== 'WAITING'`, dispatch is aborted. Zero follow-up emails are sent after a reply is registered.

### 10. Authoritative Outbound Safety & Idempotency
- **Idempotency Key Determinism**: Every outbound message generates a deterministic idempotency key formatted as `idem_${executionId}_step_${stepIndex}`.
- **Pre-Send Delivery Ledger Reservation**: Before contacting the email provider (Gmail, SMTP), a delivery row is reserved with `status = 'PENDING'` or `status = 'RESERVED'`. If a duplicate request arrives, SQLite's unique constraint on `idempotencyKey` rejects the duplicate dispatch immediately.

### 11. Immutable Template Versions & Execution Lineage
- **Pinned Versioning**: When an execution is initiated, it pins the exact integer `templateVersion` of each step.
- **Variables Snapshot**: Contact variables (e.g. `firstName`, `companyName`) are snapshotted at execution start.
- **Immutability Invariant**: Editing or deleting a template never alters historical deliveries or in-flight executions. Executions continue resolving their pinned version and snapshot, ensuring 100% auditability and zero template drift.

### 12. Suppression & Unsuppression Consistency
- **Normalized Address Matching**: The suppression repository normalizes all email addresses (`toLowerCase().trim()`) and supports both domain-level (`@domain.com`) and recipient-level entries.
- **Multi-Address Isolation**: A bounce on a primary email address suppresses only that specific address; alternate secondary emails remain eligible for outreach.
- **UNSUPPRESS-13 Precedence**: Administrative unsuppression safely restores contacts with past successful touchpoints to `CONTACTED`, while fresh contacts return to `NEW`. Contacts that previously replied (`REPLIED`) or requested do-not-contact (`DO_NOT_CONTACT`) are strictly protected from status overwrite.

### 13. Inbound Reconciliation & Correlation
- **Three-Tier Correlation Algorithm**: Inbound replies are matched against outbound sends using: (1) `In-Reply-To` / `References` provider message IDs, (2) Gmail thread ID, and (3) normalized subject + recipient address heuristics.
- **Exponential Backoff Re-indexing**: Inbound replies that arrive before the provider thread propagates are assigned `processingStatus: 'CORRELATION_PENDING'` and re-indexed with bounded exponential backoff (max 5 attempts).
- **Manual Operator Reconciliation**: Unmatched inbound replies surface in the UI for 1-click operator reconciliation with workspace-scoped authorization.

### 14. Provider Failure Classification & Ambiguous Send Safety
- **Deterministic Error Mapping**: Provider errors are categorized into `RATE_LIMIT` (HTTP 429), `AUTH_ERROR` (HTTP 401/403), `INVALID_RECIPIENT` (HTTP 400/550), and `AMBIGUOUS` (network timeouts, socket drops, HTTP 502/503/504).
- **Ambiguous Send Invariant**: Under network drops where provider acceptance is uncertain, the delivery is marked `status = 'AMBIGUOUS'`. Scheduler sweeps are strictly barred from re-dispatching this step. Authoritative reconciliation polls the provider's Sent folder to confirm or deny transmission before any retry is permitted.

### 15. Multi-Tenant Isolation & Security Authorization
- **Rigorous Workspace Context Guard**: All API endpoints and IPC handlers validate the caller's authenticated user session and explicit `workspaceId`.
- **Zero Cross-Tenant Leakage**: Attempting to query, mutate, reconcile, or requeue resources belonging to another workspace results in HTTP 403 or 404. All repository queries strictly scope database predicates by `workspaceId`.
- **Secret & Credential Privacy**: Mailbox records, API responses, IPC payloads, and log entries redact OAuth access tokens, refresh tokens, and client secrets.
