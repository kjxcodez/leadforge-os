# LeadForge OS Documentation

LeadForge OS is a local-first lead generation and cold outreach platform built as an Electron desktop application. By running crawlers, browser scrapers, and AI enrichments directly on local developer or user machines, it avoids high cloud infrastructure costs and secures sensitive outbound prospecting data.

This documentation serves as the technical reference for developers, contributors, and maintainers.
