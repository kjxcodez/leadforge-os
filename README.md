## 🚀 Hero Section & Product Cockpit

LeadForge OS is a desktop application designed for B2B lead generation, website crawling, contact enrichment, and automated cold email campaigns. Instead of relying on expensive seat-based cloud platforms that charge high infrastructure markups and upload your database to third parties, LeadForge OS executes scrapers, headless browsers, data-mining operations, and local LLMs **directly on your local hardware**.

## 🎯 Why LeadForge OS Exists

Commercial outbound platforms (e.g. Apollo, Lemlist, Instantly) operate on centralized cloud environments. This model introduces three major drawbacks:

1. **High Infrastructure markups**: Web crawling and scraping Google Maps at scale consumes heavy proxy and bandwidth resources, leading to expensive subscription tiers.
2. **Data Privacy Risks**: Uploading customer lists, prospect profiles, and private SMTP/IMAP credentials to third-party databases exposes your sales pipeline to security leaks.
3. **Crawl & Send Throttling**: Centralized platforms limit crawling rates and email check frequencies to manage their own cloud costs.

**LeadForge OS solves this** by executing high-concurrency scraping (via Playwright), crawler parsers (via Cheerio), local databases (via SQLite WAL-mode), local LLM inference (via Ollama), and local OS-native credentials encryption (via safeStorage) directly on the client machine. Networks are treated as synchronization transport layers rather than the primary application hosts.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Google Maps Scraper (`scraper:maps`)**: Runs headless Playwright browsers, performs infinite scrolls on business listings, resolves domain redirects, and extracts addresses.
- **Website Crawler (`crawler:website`)**: Runs BFS Cheerio crawlers on discovered domains, parsing emails, phone numbers, and identifying tracking/spam traps.
- **LinkedIn Voyager Enricher (`enrich:linkedin`)**: Leverages active session cookies to query LinkedIn APIs and locate matching CEO, Founder, or VP decision-maker profiles.
- **Sequence Drip Engine (`automation:workflow`)**: Maps multi-step sequences (`IF`, `WAIT`, `SEND_EMAIL`, `HTTP_REQUEST`) executing inside a sandboxed worker child process.
- **IMAP Reply Poller (`outreach:imap-poll`)**: Scans inbox replies, correlating conversations via `In-Reply-To`/`References` headers to automatically pause outbound campaigns.
- **SRE Cockpit & Diagnostics**: Measures database latency, pings network sockets, checks SMTP/IMAP ports, runs SQLite integrity checks, and queries system logs.
- **OS Keychain safeStorage**: Encrypts sensitive keys, tokens, and passwords in the database using OS-level credential managers (Electron `safeStorage`).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

LeadForge OS separates intensive automation workflows and scrapers from the React user interface. Long-running scrapers or workflows are spawned as isolated Node.js child processes to prevent blocking the UI thread or crashing the desktop application.

## ⚙️ Workspace Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: `v18.0.0` or higher
- **pnpm**: `v8.0.0` or higher
- **Git**: Installed and configured
- **Ollama** (Optional): For running local qualification models offline

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kjxcodez/leadforge-os.git
   cd leadforge-os
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build all workspace packages:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

---

## 💻 Development Workflow

To start development runtimes for both the Hono API server and the Electron application:

```bash
# Run all apps in development mode (API & Desktop UI)
pnpm dev

# Run only the Hono REST API server
pnpm dev --filter=api

# Run only the Electron Desktop application
pnpm dev --filter=@leadforge/desktop
```

### Key CLI Commands

- `pnpm build`: Compiles all packages and application bundles.
- `pnpm check-types`: Compiles TypeScript with `--noEmit` across all workspace targets.
- `pnpm lint`: Lints the monorepo codebase using ESLint.
- `pnpm test`: Executes unit and integration test suites.
- `pnpm test:ai`: Validates AI connections and LLM providers.
- `pnpm doctor`: Runs the 11-step SRE local diagnostic tool.
- `pnpm release:check`: Validates the 10-step release gates before bundling.
